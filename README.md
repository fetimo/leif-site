# leif-site

The source code for [https://leif.support](https://leif.support).

This website is built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). This framework and the architecture choices made keep the carbon footprint low by adhering to the following principles:

* minimise the amount of JS shipped at runtime
* deploy to the edge so data doesn't have to travel far
* minimise changes

## Deployment process

Branches are deployed via Cloudflare Pages and can be managed in the dashboard. 

New binary releases are managed in R2.
